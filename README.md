# Call-Of-The-Wild

Shortly after completing Rockit Bootcamp I was at home filling out applications and chasing down job leads when it 
occured to me that my dad didn't have a website for his business. I thought, "how cool would it be to surprize him with a website." So I went to dribbble looking for some design inspiration and found parts and pieces of several websites that would make a cool idea. Here is the result.

Since this is essentially a static site I put the live version up here. I will continue to edit it but the actual site will be different when it launches.
