# Call-Of-The-Wild

Shortly after completing Rockit Bootcamp I was at home filling out applications and chasing down job leads when it 
occured to me that my dad didn't have a website for his business. I thought, "how cool would it be to surprize him with a website." So I went to dribbble looking for some design inspiration and found parts and pieces of several websites that would make a cool idea.

I started fleshing it out and it just came together. I had never put together a gallery before and so I looked up some examples to copy. It turns out now that I have seen better ideas with a responsive grid and lightbox features but what I have accomplished will have to do until I can get the site more features. For now enjoy Call Of The Wild.
