# Call-Of-The-Wild

Shortly after completing Rockit Bootcamp I was at home filling out applications and chasing down job leads when it 
occured to me that my dad didn't have a website for his business. I thought, "how cool would it be to surprize him with a website." So I went to dribbble looking for some design inspiration and found parts and pieces of several websites that would make a cool idea.

Since this is essentially a static site I put the live version up here. I will continue to edit it but the actual site will be different when it launches.

<h3> ** Update ** </h3>

<p> After much thought and debate it has been decided that this site will be re-written from scratch, so I effectively kill off this project and just leave the code as an early learning experience. It was truly one of my proudest accomplishments early on, but as you learn and grow in development you discover the need to do things a different way. Besides that, my dad has different business needs now and the site just needs a complete redo. Long live Call Of The Wild! </p>
