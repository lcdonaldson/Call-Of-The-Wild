                <p>"Born and raised as an outdoorsman in the southwest I grew up loving the mountains
                and all the wildlife found there. As I reached adulthood I became a flight nurse which
                took me to Alaska. Traveling around Anchorage i was able to see artists work that they 
                carved into antlers. I loved their carvings but none of them captured what I wanted to
                see. I wanted to see carvings of the animals that I had hunted.

                I had a dremel tool for minor projects at home and I thought...I can do this. I found
                a caribou antler, sanded off an area to sketch on, and then started to drill away. 
                Call OF THE WILD was born. Since then I have spent thousands of hours carving everything 
                from deer antlers, to whale baleen, to gun stocks. I hope you enjoy them as much as I
                do, and please contact me if you would like your own unique carving."
